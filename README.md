<h1>Osbornes Furniture AR App</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This AR app, created in Unity using ARFoundation, allows users to preview how furniture will look in their home before making a purchase. It features a range of furniture types with options to change materials and colors, and users can manipulate items by rotating, scaling, or moving them. The app also includes light estimation to ensure realistic integration of furniture into any space.

This project marked my introduction to the Unity XR toolkit and provided valuable experience in developing augmented reality applications.
